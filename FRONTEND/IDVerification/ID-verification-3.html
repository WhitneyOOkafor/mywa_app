                Hi! We're so glad you signed upâ€”and we're almost done with the verification process. All that's left is for us to verify
                your ID and facial scans.<br /><br />
                
                The first step is to scan your ID. It should be a clear image of your ID, so make sure it's in focus and that there
                aren't any obstructions in the way (like a folder or other items). Once it's uploaded, we'll take care of the rest.
